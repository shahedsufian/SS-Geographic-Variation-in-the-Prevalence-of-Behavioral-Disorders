## Abstract
**Research Objective:**
In the United States, Arkansas ranks second highest for the percentage of children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) are common comorbidities of ADHD. These three behavioral disorders have significant public health impacts as they impede the social, emotional, and personal development in children and adolescents. These conditions persist into adulthood where they can cause negative health outcomes, and impact social, employment, and financial stability. To aid in developing interventions to improve treatment of those diagnosed with behavioral disorders in Arkansas, this study aimed to describe geographic variation in the prevalence of behavioral disorders among children and adolescents in Arkansas.

**Study Design:**
This study used a retrospective cross-sectional design aggregating the prevalence of behavioral disorders at the ZIP-code level in the Arkansas All-Payer Claims Database (APCD) to evaluate variation across the 696 ZIP-codes in Arkansas (lowest level of geography recorded in the APCD). ZIP-codes were grouped into quintiles based on the prevalence of behavioral disorders among the children and adolescent population. ZIP-codes in quintile 1 (Q1) had the lowest prevalence of behavioral disorders, whereas those in quintile 5 (Q5) had the highest. Population characteristics and medical claims data from the Arkansas All-Payer Claims Database, 2019, were linked to Child Opportunity Index 2.0 ZIP-code neighborhood characteristic data. APCD data from 2019 was analyzed to mitigate potential environmental confounding during the COVID-19 pandemic years. Metrics used to measure geographic variation included the coefficient of variation (COV), the ratio of 90th percentile to 10th percentile, and generalized linear models to test for differences in population and neighborhood characteristics across quintiles.

**Population Studied:**
Our study included Arkansas children and adolescents aged 4-17 years who were enrolled in health coverage plans reporting claims to the Arkansas APCD during 2019. We identified 421,631 children.

**Principal Findings:**
The rate of behavioral disorders among the study population was 8.2%. There was substantial variation in rates of behavioral disorders prevalence across ZIP-code aggregated quintiles (Q1: 5.0%; Q2: 7.1%; Q3: 8.6%; Q4: 10.1%; Q5: 13.1%), with a COV of 31.7% and a 90th-to-10th-percentile prevalence ratio of 2.4. By geographic region, North-East Arkansas had the highest concentration of high-prevalence ZIP-codes, whereas North-West Arkansas had higher concentrations of low-prevalence ZIP-codes. The COI constructed scores for education (51.3 vs 36.1; p<0.0001), health and environment (38.3 vs 32.2; p<0.0001), and social and economic domains (40.3 vs 25.4; p<0.0001), as well as the overall (40.3 vs 27; p<0.0001), were significantly higher in Q1 compared to Q5. Both the percentages of the public and private insured study population were significantly higher in Q1 compared to Q5. The percentage of non-Hispanic black study population was statistically significantly (p<0.0001) higher in Q5: 13.65% compared to Q1: 7.1%.

**Conclusions:**
Findings demonstrate significant variation in behavioral disordersâ€™ prevalence across Arkansas ZIP-codes. Overall and the three domain-specific child opportunity scores were higher in the lowest-prevalence quintile compared to the highest-prevalence quintile.

**Implications for Policy or Practice:**
This study can help identify disparate populations and develop focused interventions. It can further inform policies and practices to decrease the unwarranted geographic variation.

## Usage
To run the code, you will need SAS installed on your machine. Follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SS-Geographic-Variation-in-the-Prevalence-of-Behavioral-Disorders.git`
2. Navigate to the `ProgramScript` folder and open the SAS code file.
3. Run the code in SAS after collecting the required datasets.
